 Sequence of Execution

 > Source code (.java) => Compiler => Byte code (.class) => Java Virtual Machine (JVM) => Native code (Binary code)
 > Native code is platform dependent (that it is different for windows, different for linux and different for mac)
 > Java code is platform independent (portable language). 

 > Java Code -> byte code (process known as compilation)
 	In case of any syntax error, compilation process fails.
 
 > Byte code -> Native code -> Execute (Execution process)
