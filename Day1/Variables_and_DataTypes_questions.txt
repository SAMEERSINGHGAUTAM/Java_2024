Question 1: In a program, input three numbers : A, B and C. You have to output the average of these three numbers.

	Pseudocode :-
			Step-1 Start
			Step-2 Input A,B and C
			Step-3 Let Average = 0
			Step-4 Average = (A+B+C)/3
			Step-5 Output Average
			Step-6 End

Question 2: In a program, input the side of a square. You have to output the area of the square.

	Pseudocode :- 
			Step-1 Start 
			Step-2 Input A
			Step-3 Let area = 0
			Step-4 area = A*A
			Step-5 Output area
			Step-6 End

Question -3 Enter the cost of three items (using float data type)- a pencil, a pen and an erase. You have to output the total cost of the items back to the user as their bill.

(Add on : You can also try adding 18% gst tax to the items in the bill as an advavanced problem.

	Psedocode :-
			step-1 start
			Step-2 Input A, B and C
			step-3 Let Cost = 0
			Step-4 Cost = A + B + C
			Step-5 GstCost = 0.18*Cost
			Step-6 Output (GstCost + Cost)
			Step-7 End

Question-4 What will be the type of result in the following Java code.

	byte b = 4;
	char c = 'a';
	short s = 512;
	int i = 1000;
	float f = 3.14f;
	double d = 99.9954;

	result = (f * b) + (i % c) - (d * s);

 Ans   result = float + int - double = double

Question-5 Will the following statement give any error in java?

		int $ = 24;
 Ans   Yes, this statement will give error because variable names do not contain any special character except "_". Here the variable name contains $.
