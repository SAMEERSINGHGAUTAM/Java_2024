 Sysmbols that tell compiler to perform some operation.\

 Expression :- 
 		sum = a+b 
	a and b are operands. "+" is operator
	Operation -> Addition
	Two magar components of an expression :-
		a. Operands (a and b)
		b. Operator (tells which operation is carried out)

> Types of operators in java
   > Arithmetic operators (Binary/Unary)
   > Relational operators
   > Logical operators
   > Bitwise operators
   > Assignment operators

> Arithmetic operators
	>Binary => + , - , * , / , %
	  
	  Those operators which need two operands to operate in an expression.

	>Unary => ++ , --

	  Those operators whch need one operand to operate in an expression.

>Modulo (%) -> This operator is used to calculate the remainder.
		
		For eg :- 10 % 5 = 0
