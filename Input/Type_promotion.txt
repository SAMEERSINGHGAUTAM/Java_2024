Type Promotion in Expressions

1. Java automatically promotes each byte, short or char operand to int when evaluating an expression

	For eg:- 
			char a = 'a' ;

			short b = 123;

			Then (a+b) -> integer . Internally , a-> integer and b -> integer and then (a+b)

2. If one operand is long, float or double the whole expression is promoted to long, float, or double respectively.

	for eg:-  
			char a = 'k';

			short b = 123;

			byte c = 56;

			int d = 5678;

			float e = 67.77f;

			Then (a+b*c/d*e) -> float

			float + long = float 
		float + long + double = double 

3. byte b = 5;
   b = b*2; // wrong 

   As range of byte is -128 to 127 and 10 lies in this range.(b*2) is an expression where b belongs to byte data type and 2 belongs to integer data type, so type promotion    happens and (b*2) belongs to integer data type.

   byte b = 5;
   b = (byte) (b*2) // correct
